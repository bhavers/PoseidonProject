# PoseidonProject

##Introduction
Poseidon aims to reduce the overuse of fresh water in the world.
The objective of the first iteration of Poseidon is to:
- Develop a water monitoring solution for educational purposes.
- Deliver education material for building the solution
- Build and support a community of cross discipline enthusiasts (scientists, hydrologists, agriculture experts, application developers, hardware experts, etc)
 
The project uses a Raspberry Pi with soil moisture and barometer sensors. The data is submitted to
Bluemix, a cloud platform (Platform as a Service), for process by application.
The code in this repository provides the Python script that will be running on the Pi.

##Usage
See the README.md files in the Tutorialx folders for instructions.
